State management in ReactJs is simply a way to engender 
communication and sharing of data across components.
We use props in React to pass data from one component 
to another (from a parent component to a child component(s)).

A fine approach to manage states is to keep all the states in the parent of 
all components so that other components can also use that data from parent. 
I have developed an counter-application to demonstrate the concept of passing data from
parent component to its children using props.Where other components are also reciveing data from
their parent component. This process is known as props drilling.

I have attached my Github account link to this project you may visit it.
